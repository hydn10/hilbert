- Smooth phase shift and use it to calculate minima.

- Different sampling frequency than simulation frequency
  (100hz should be good i think).

- Add noise.

- Implement peak detection algorithm and compare it to hilbert.

- Simulate a faulty damper.

- Generate test runs with good/bad dampers and compare various methods
  and their success rates.
